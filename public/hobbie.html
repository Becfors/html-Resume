<li>Another hobby that I am deeply passionate about is sports. Regular physical activity has been an integral part of my life, as it not only keeps me fit but also instills discipline and perseverance. Whether it's playing team sports like soccer and basketball or enjoying solitary activities like running and swimming, I find immense satisfaction in challenging myself to push beyond my limits.</li>
